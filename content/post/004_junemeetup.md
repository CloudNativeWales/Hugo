# OUR SECOND MEETUP

Wednesday, June 20th, 6pm at DevOpsGroup offices, Cardiff.

At the offices of the (newly-rebranded) [DevOpsGroup](https://www.devopsgroup.com/), on the 22nd floor overlooking Cardiff Castle, the [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-Wales/events/lxwbppyxjbsb/) was kicked off by [Lewis](https://twitter.com/denhamparry) and [Salman](https://twitter.com/soulmaniqbal), with a brief reminder of what CloudNativeWales is, and the community's [Code of Conduct](https://communitycodeofconduct.com/).

Then it was time for the first talk!

### Talk: Hassle-free, scalable Machine Learning with Kubeflow

#### [Basia Fusinska](https://twitter.com/@basiafusinska)

Basia works at Google in London as a Strategic Cloud Engineer and has a strong background in both software development and Machine Learning algorithms. She opened her talk by asking the audience for suggestions on how to define Machine Learning. Jupyter notebooks, and then Kubeflow.

### Talk: Running Kubernetes without Docker using CRI

#### [Ben Hall](https://twitter.com/@Ben_Hall)

Before containers can launch, they need to be built. Ben gave an overview of how Container Builders are evolving and the benefits and tradeoffs that come from using each of them.

Ben then gave a runthrough of how to run Kubernetes with CRI (Container Runtime Interface) allowing the user to use ContainerD, CRI-O and other container runtimes beyond the (default) Docker container runtime. Ben demonstrated using [Katacoda](https://katacoda.com/), the in-browser Interactive Learning and Training Platform, which is especially good for learning Cloud Native technolgies.

The Container Runtime Interface. Virtual Kubelet.

### Raffle: Prizes of Conference Passes and copies of [Cloud Native Infrastructure](https://blog.cloudnativewales.io/cloudnativeinfrastructure/)
