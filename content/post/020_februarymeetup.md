* Kubernetes Operators
* Difficulty of developing operators using operator framework and kubebuilder
* Introducing KUDO
* Core Concepts of KUDO

* OperatorVersion
* Instance
* Plans
* PlanExecutions
* KUDO CLI Extension to kubectl
* KUDO Architecture

Kubernetes Operators are the next phase of the journey towards automating complex applications in containers. The Kudo project introduces an easy way to build Kubernetes operators using declarative YAML. Many Operators that exist today handle initial deployment, but they don’t provide automation for tasks like binary upgrades, configuration updates, and failure recovery.

Implementing a production-grade controller for a complex workload typically requires thousands of lines of code and many months of development. As a result, the quality of operators that are available today varies. The Kudo project provides a universal operator to enable automated creation of operators for Kubernetes, in most cases just using YAML. In this talk, Matt introduces the Kudo project, and demo the creation of a Kubernetes operator using Kudo.

This was a great talk with a lot of questions and interaction with everyone in the room. Speaking for myself I definitely learnt a lot and will be taking KUDO for a test drive.

A question that came up a lot was when to use Helm vs KUDO, you can find the answer [here](https://kudo.dev/docs/comparison.html)
