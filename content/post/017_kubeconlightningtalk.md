# The Lightning Talk

[Lewis Denham-Parry](https://twitter.com/denhamparry) talked about Cloud Native Wales at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2019](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2019/). The talk was titled, *Cloud Native Wales: Cloud Native Wales: How We Contributed to the Community with No Code*.

## Cloud Native Wales - The Origins

The purpose of the talk was to encourage and provide tips to the attendees so they can learn, grow and give back to the people and the community around them. Lewis talked about how himself and his co-organiser, [Salman Iqbal](https://twitter.com/soulmaniqbal), with the help of the community started Cloud Native Wales.

Cloud Native Wales started when Lewis attended a workshop hosted by [Ben Hall](https://twitter.com/Ben_Hall), creator and founder of [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/). Ben suggested that Lewis & Salman set up a Cloud Native user group in [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales), as there wasn't one already.

Lewis & Salman then ran a Kubernetes workshop at [Yolk Recruitment](https://www.yolkrecruitment.com/) offices in Cardiff, to start their public speaking journey. 

## 3 Things needed to run a Meetup

__1. Venue__

Lewis & Salman were lucky to meet [Stephen Thair](https://twitter.com/TheOpsMgr), co-founder of [DevOpsGroup](https://www.devopsgroup.com/). Stephen offered us an opportunity to host our meetup at their offices in the centre of Cardiff. The venue has a 360 Degree view of Cardiff, you can even see [Cardiff Castle](https://www.cardiffcastle.com/) from the venue. DevOpsGroup have been supporting us for over a year now! Thanks DevOpsGroup!

__2. Speakers__

It is surprising how many people in your locality are working on exciting projects and are willing to speak at your meetup. As an example, when CNW started, we found out that [James Rawlings](https://twitter.com/jdrawlings), co-creator of [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) was local to us! James came and spoke at our first meetup. Pro tip: when you see a speaker that you really like, approach them and invite them to speak at your meetup. The Cloud Native speakers are always willing to speak at meetups. Reach them out on twitter, email them, speak to them at KubeCon.

__3. Attendees__

There is no easy way to solve this. You will have to hustle a little bit to spread the word. 

- Create a twitter account to promote your meetup 
- Speak and attend other meetups to get your meetup's name out
- Write blogs about how you got started

## 3 Tips

__1. Be Yourself:__ Lewis mentioned how sometimes he suffers with imposter syndrome. By being yourself you will be more relaxed and bring your own flavour to the community.

__2. Help Others:__ If you need help in learning about a new technology or language, reach out to others. You can make it easier for yourself by helping others. Once you give back to the people around you, you will find that people are more willing to help you.

__3. Do it for the Community:__ Work with the people around you to help you grow the community and attract speakers and attendees. Cloud Native Wales would not have been possible without the help of a lot of people, some of them were mentioned in the talk, we could not have done without them:

_4. Treat others as you wanted to be treated: Always use a code of conduct at your meetup so it is welcoming to everyone. Check out Linux Foundation's [Code of Conduct](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/code-of-conduct/) as a starting point. 

## Meetup Initiatives

In addition to hosting the meetups, Cloud Native Wales have a few more initiatives:

- *Swag*: When Lewis & Salman attend conferences, they grab some stickers & swags to take them back to their meetup to give them out. This gives an opportunity for members who could not attend conferences to get their hands on the swag.
- *Raffle*: If you are speaking at a conference, ask them to provide you a ticket so you could give it away at your meetup. We've been lucky to partner with [Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/), who provide us with tickets to their conferences to give away!
- *Book Club*: We got in touch with the authors of Cloud Native books to do a Google hangout session. Members would read a book beforehand and will give them a chance to ask them questions about their book.
- *Tech Amnesty*: We collect old games consoles from community members and donate them to the local hospitals.
- *Meetup of Meetups*: We join forces with other technical local meetups to host a joint meetup.

Lewis mentioned that by starting the community he's had more opportunities to grow his career. He's been working as a instructor with [Learnk8s.io](https://learnk8s.io/) recently. From today, he will be joining [Jetstack](https://www.jetstack.io/). 

As a closing remark, Lewis enforced the point that the tech landscape is changing all the time. The only thing that is always there for him and others is the community. He knows that when he needs help with a new technology/issue, he can reach out to the community who will be more than willing to help him and others!
