# Streaming to Wales

Since creating Cloud Native Wales, we've wanted to make sure we can share as much of the content with people throughout Wales.
The reason we setup the meetup was that not everyone could make the meetups and conferences hosted outside of Wales, so we brought it to Cardiff.
But not everyone can make it to Cardiff, so how do we fix that?

## Lessons from Football

I once heard a story about Football being streamed live at 3pm within the UK, outside of the UK people can watch Saturday 3pm kickoffs live but we can't do that with TV services in the UK.
This was due to the fear that no one would turn up to the games, and that ticket sales would drop.
We want to make sure we bring people together and start conversations, not just with speakers but with attendees.
But we also want to make sure that if you can't make the meetup (whether that's from not being able to get to Cardiff, can't arrange child care etc) that you can still learn from the talks.

## Solution

From our first meetup we share swag that we've picked up from conferences.  If you have stickers, people will come.
Since then, we've been able to raffle off conference tickets which encourages people to turn up for a chance of winning.

## Livestream setup.

We're going to be using YouTube to stream the event.   Here's a list of software/hardware that we'll be using to get it all to work:

* (OBS)[https://obsproject.com]
* Macbook Pro (2017 model)
* (Razor Kiyo webcam)[https://www.razer.com/gb-en/gaming-broadcaster/razer-kiyo]
* (Blue Yeti microphone)[https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/]
