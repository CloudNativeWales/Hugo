# v0.0.2-Anouska

## The one where with the toughest question

[Anouska Streets](https://twitter.com/AnouskaStreets) has been a key part of [Cloud Native Wales](https://cloudnativewales.io) from Day 1 supporting us and  to speaking at the [April 2019 Meetup](https://cloudnativewales.io/post/015_aprilmeetup/).

In this episode we talk to Anouska about how she got started in the industry, her love of Cloud Native tech, being a part of the community and helping people around her grow.

Links to points discussed in the podcast can be found in the [CNW MVP Show Notes](https://cloudnativewales.io//post/cnw_mvp_002_anouska/).
