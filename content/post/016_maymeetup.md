## Agenda

### Anouska Streets ([@AnouskaStreets](https://twitter.com/AnouskaStreets))

*Beyond the Platform Experience - Exploring how our brains work under cognitive load and applying these insights to create a holistic developer experience that enables software engineers to reach their full potential.*

Cognitive load is a key factor in determining how well we can solve problems and learn new things. Software delivery is a creative process chock-full of problem solving and continuous learning, and platforms like Cloud Foundry and Heroku have worked hard to ease a developer’s cognitive load, providing straightforward developer experiences on opinionated platforms that enable engineers to focus on the delivery of business value.

But the developer experience is more than just the interactions between the developer and the platform.

Join Anouska Streets in exploring the work of “The Godfather of Cognitive Load Theory” John Sweller and other academics; discover what happens inside our brains when we have problems to solve and new things to learn; and learn what we can do as individuals and technology leaders to build upon these insights and maximise the focus of our engineers on the delivery of real value.

Introduction to Time-Series
Time-Series has been the fastest growing database category, rated, by DBEngines, for over 2 years; yet, less than 15% store their time-series data in a time-series database. Do you?

One could, accurately, say that time-series data is as old as the universe; but it wasn't until the mid-19th century that the first article was published on the concept: A Comparison of the Fluctuations in the Price of Wheat and in the Cotton and Silk Imports into Great Britain by J. H. Poynting (March 1884).

Time-Series data is so natural and common that you actually consume, evaluate, and utilise it everyday; when you're:

- Paying for your morning coffee
- Sighing at the "Delayed" notice on your commute
- Hugging your coffee mug as you process your email inbox

In this talk we will look at the different types of time-series data and how to use that to drive observations, understanding, and automation.

"All data becomes an order of magnitude more interesting on the time dimension" - Let's see why.
