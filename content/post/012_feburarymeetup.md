## Meetup Details

### Speakers

#### Matt Turner

Matt is a software engineer at Tetrate, working on Istio-related products. He's been doing Dev, sometimes with added Ops, for over a decade. His idea of "full-stack" is Linux, Kubernetes, and now Istio too. He's given several talks and workshops on Kubernetes and Istio, and is co-organiser of the Istio London meetup. He tweets https://twitter.com/mt165
and blogs at https://mt165.co.uk

#### Lewis Denham-Parry

Lewis is the Co-Founder of Cloud Native Wales.

##### Talk - Scaling Microservices with Message Queues, DotNet Core and Kubernetes

When you design and build applications at scale, you deal with two significant challenges: scalability & robustness. You should design your service so that even if it is subject to intermittent heavy loads, it continues to operate reliably. But how do you build such applications? And how do you deploy an application that scales dynamically? Kubernetes has a feature called autoscaler where instances of your applications are increased or decreased automatically based on metrics that you define.
In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how to design, package & deploy reliable .NET applications to Kubernetes & decouple several components using a message broker. You will also learn how to set autoscaling rules to cope with an increasing influx of messages in the queue.

### AI Wales Meetup

We usually run our event on the 2nd Thursday of every month, so have decided to move dates due to Valentines day. We've spoken to AI Wales who run their meetup on the 1st Thursday of the month and have decided that we can run both together as there should be little chance of a clash of conflicts.

The AI Wales meetup can be found [here](https://www.meetup.com/AI-Wales/events/258292482/).

Cardiff is rapidly growing, and there are more meetups happening each month. We're trying our best not conflict with other talks so that you get the opportunity to attend as many as you wish.

Sorry for any inconvenience
