# Acknowledgements

We have to say a massive thanks to [DevOpsGroup](https://www.devopsgroup.com/) for supporting us and helping us grow the Cloud Native Community in Wales for over a year! They have provided us with a stunning venue for our meetups. All the drinks and food provided by them also goes down well! Head over to their [careers page](https://www.devopsgroup.com/careers/) to check out exciting vacancies.

#### Rootless, Reproducible & Hermetic - Secure Container Build Showdown
Rootless container image builds (as distinct from rootless runtimes) have crept ever closer with orca-build, BuildKit, and img proving the concept. And they are desperately needed: a build pipeline with an exposed Docker socket can be used by an attacker to escalate privilege - and is probably a backdoor into most Kubernetes-based CI build farms. 

With a slew of new rootless tooling emerging including Red Hat’s buildah, Google’s Kaniko, and Uber’s Makisu, will we see build systems that can securely build untrusted Dockerfiles? How are traditional build and packaging requirements like reproducibility or hermetic isolation being approached? 

In this talk Andrew informs us on: 
* Container image build security
* Rootlessness, reproducibility, and hermeticism
* Attack and defence for an OCI image build
* Comparison of present and future tooling
* Securing untrusted builds

#### Towards a Low-Carbon Cloud 
Coinciding with this fortnight's international action on the climate emergency, this talk offers a timely outline of some of the latest research being conducted into minimising the significant and growing, Carbon emissions resulting from our use of The Cloud.

In this talk Aled informs us on:
 * A low carbon Kubernetes Scheduler
 * Weird and Wonderful Datacentre implementations
    * Nerdalize
    * Microsoft Project Natick
* The shortcomings of a Low Carbon Kubernetes Scheduler
