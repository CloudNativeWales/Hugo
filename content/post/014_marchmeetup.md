# OUR ELEVENTH MEETUP

Thursday, March 14th, 6pm at DevOpsGroup offices, Cardiff.

## Sponsors

* [Talk Video](https://youtu.be/5c8gB1U3YPA?t=946)

Sadly, this was our first live video and the encoding on the stream couldn't handle it.
Its not ideal but there is audio available but the final part of the talk is missing.
We apologies to Brendan for this, but will forever be grateful for helping us test out live streaming.
