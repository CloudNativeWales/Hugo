## Meetup Details

## Speaker: Brice Fernandes | Weaveworks

Brice (https://twitter.com/fractallambda) is a software engineer, entrepreneur and instructor at Weaveworks (https://twitter.com/weaveworks).

Brice fell in love with programming while studying physics and never really looked back since. He has a broad technology background that covers everything from embedded C to backendless browser apps using the trendiest javascript frameworks. He taught Game Development and Functional Programming online and founded his own education platform for developers before joining Weaveworks. He now spends his time helping companies make the most of Kubernetes.

## Session

In this hands-on session, Brice will go through the principles and practices of Gitops, an operational model developed and codified at Weaveworks. He will show you how to implement Gitops in practice on Kubernetes using open source tools. After this session, you'll be able to set up your own Gitops deployment and management pipelines.

Attendees should:
* Be comfortable with Git
* Be comfortable with the Unix command line

No preparation needed. Attendees will be provided with an online environment to use during the tutorial. Bring a laptop with a modern browser.

## Speaker: Steve Davis | ipconsultants.org.uk

Steve Davis is highly experienced in developing and taking to market colocation, cloud products and services as well as connectivity. Originally working in IT and telecoms he moved into cloud services 5 years ago and has developed Cloud Exchanges and Hybrid Cloud infrastructure.

## Lightning talk

Wales has had an Internet Exchange since 2014 but little is known about what it does and the benefits it can bring. Steve will cover the history of the Exchange, why regional peering is becoming more important and how 1 in 3 of the Welsh population will shortly be able to access it.
